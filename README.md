# Inventario_Senderos
A project about an inventory for my mom's restaurant.
To run this Project you need Python 3.7 installed and the ... package (pip install ...).
The objective of this software is to be able to easily manage a restaurant (it can be modified to suit more tipes of bussineses) stock and sales. It automates the relation between an Excel file where the products on stock are listed and another Excel file where the sold products are listed.
If you have any feedback, feel free to contact me or contribute.
